# Spring Chinook Salmon in the Portland Metro Area

## Project Description

**Goal:** Our goal was to find a correlation between the “2008-2019” water’s effect on the Native Chinook Salmon Populations in the “Lower Columbia” area during their migration cycle to spawn in the “Spring”.

**Background:** Chinook Salmon is on the "endangered species" list that the "state" is actively tracking to protect.
As a keystone species it is of utmost importance to implement measures for conservation and education.

**Proposal:** Target whether past state conservation efforts have been effective.
